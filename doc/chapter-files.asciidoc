By default, Newsboat stores all the files in a traditional Unix fashion, i.e.
in a "dotdir" located at _~/.newsboat_. However, it also supports a modern
way,
https://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html[XDG Base Directory Specification],
which splits the files between the following locations:

- _$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/newsboat/_
- _$XDG_DATA_HOME/newsboat/_

If `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` environment variable is not set, Newsboat behaves as if it
was set to _~/.config_. Similarly, `XDG_DATA_HOME` defaults to
_~/.local/share_.

If the config directory exists, Newsboat will use XDG directories, otherwise it
will default to _~/.newsboat_.

If you're currently using _~/.newsboat/_ but wish to migrate to XDG
directories, you should move the files as follows:

_config_, _urls_::
        to _$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/newsboat/_

_cache.db_, _history.search_, _history.cmdline_, _queue_::
        to _$XDG_DATA_HOME/newsboat/_
